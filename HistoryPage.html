					<h2>ANCIENT BAHRAIN</h2>
				</header>
					<dl>
						<dt>DILMUN</dt>
							<dd>Dilmun is first mentioned in Sumerian cuneiform
							clay tablets from the end of the 4th millennium BC, 
							found in the temple of goddess Inanna, in the city of Uruk.
							Sennacherib, king of Assyria (707-681) BC, attacked the
							northeast Persian Gulf and captured Bahrain, according to a
							monument discovered in Bahrain.</dd>
						<dt>PERSIAN EMPIRE</dt>
							<dd>Bahrain played an important role in the Persian Empire
							from the 6th century BC until the 3rd century BC. 
							There were also two Iranian dynasties controlling Bahrain, 
							the Parthians and the Sassanids. In the 3rd century AD, the 
							Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the 
							arrival of Islam four centuries later.</dd>
						<dt>TYLOS</dt>
							<dd>When Nearchus, a Greek admiral serving under Alexander the
							Great, overthrew Al Hamar's rule, Bahrain was called Tylos, and
							it was the centre of pearl trading. Alexander planned to settle 
							the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf with Greek colonists, but
							it is not known whether Bahrain was part of the Seleucid Empire. 
							The archaeological site at Qalat Al Bahrain has been proposed as 
							a Seleucid base.</dd>

					<h2>ISLAM IN BAHRAIN</h2>
				</header>
					<p>When Bahrain adopted Islam in 629 (the seventh year of hijra), the Prophet 
					Mohammed ruled Bahrain through Al-Ala'a Al-Hadhrami. Under Umar I, Abu Hurayrah 
					was the governor of Bahrain. </p>

					<p>Established in 692, Al Khamis Mosque was one of the first mosques built in 
					Bahrain during the reign of Umar II, the Umayyad caliph. Bahrain was a center of 
					Nestorian Christianity before Islam.</p>

					<p>Bahrain's dependence on trade did not change with Islam, and its prosperity 
					continued to be dependent on markets in Mesopotamia. When Baghdad became the 
					caliphate and the center of Islamic civilization in 750,
					Bahrain greatly benefited from the increase in the city's demand for imported goods,
					particularly from China and South Asia.</p>

					<h2>DYNASTIES</h2>
				</header>
					<dl>
						<dt>QARMATIANS</dt>
							<dd>Approximately 900 years ago, Abu Sa'id al-Hasan al-Jannabi 
							led a rebellion by a messianic Ismaili sect originating in 
							present-day Kufa, Iraq. Al-Jannabi seized Hajr, Bahrain's capital 
							at the time. Qarmatians aimed to build a society that was based on 
							reason and equality. Initiates had equal access to the property 
							within their community. Although Qarmatian society was esoteric, 
							their activities were public and openly propagated.</dd>
						<dt>UYUNID</dt>
							<dd>With the help of the Great Seljuq Empire's armies, 
							Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni captured the nation from the 
							Qarmatians in Bahrain and Al-Hasa in 1076â€“1077, establishing the
							Uyunid dynasty and the Uyunid Emirate. From the 11th to the 13th 
							centuries, the Uyunid dynasty ruled Bahrain for 163 years.</dd>
						<dt>JABRID</dt>
							<dd>Zamil ibn Jabir took control of Bahrain in the mid-15th century, 
							establishing the Bedouin Jabrid dynasty. The Jabrids dominated most 
							of eastern Arabia from al-Ahsa, and they practiced the Sunni Maliki 
							rite, which they zealously propagated within their territory.</dd>
						<dt>PORTUGESE</dt>
							<dd>Attracted by the rich trade routes of the Gulf, the Portuguese 
							wanted control of the key Ormus region before moving on to Bahrain. 
							In 1485, Portuguese ships first entered the Gulf, and Duarte Barbosa 
							is said to have been the first Portuguese traveller to explore Bahrain. 
							Hormuz' governmental authority of Bahrain was lost once the Kingdom 
							of Hormuz fell in 1507, when the island passed to the prince of 
							Al-Hasa.</dd>

					<h2>THE BRITISH AND BAHRAIN</h2>
				</header>
					<p>The Al Khalifa tribe reclaimed control in Bahrain in 1820 and signed a treaty with 
					the United Kingdom, which was then the main military power in the Persian Gulf. 
					This contract established the Al Khalifa as Bahrain's rulers ("Al-Hakim" in Arabic). 
					The 1861 Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship, which was revised in 1892 and 1951,
					was the first of multiple treaties.</p>

					<p>This pact was identical to the ones that the British government had made with the 
					other Persian Gulf princedoms. It said that the ruler could not sell any of his land 
					to anyone other than the United Kingdom, and that he could not form any relationships 
					with foreign governments without British permission. In exchange, the British vowed 
					to defend Bahrain from any maritime incursion and to assist in the event of a land 
					attack. More crucially, the British committed to back Bahrain's Al Khalifa rulers.</p>
